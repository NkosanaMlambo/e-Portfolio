   <li> Elements within the scientific method.</li>
   <li> Aspects of ethical issues in research and professional practice.</li>

												<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>Initial challenges faced in the module included a large amount of reading material, learning materials from the lecturer, and the need to prepare for a seminar and collaborative discussions. This was a valuable unit, but I was not well-prepared due to other commitments. The reading material provided insights into deductive and inductive reasoning, research concepts, and the importance of ethics. The unit set the foundation for understanding the role of ethics in research and I believe it should have also introduced the concepts of positivism and post-positivism, which Adam (2013) defines as the epistemological and methodological frame of reference that defines the attitude and relation of the researcher to the production of data and the selection of research tools and methods. I plan to improve my time management in the future to fully engage with module activities. The importance of time management enhances job performance, academic achievement, and well-being (Aeon et al., 2021). </p><br>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>The focus of the unit involved selecting a research topic, formulating questions, and planning the literature review and research proposal. I experienced anxiety when choosing a topic but eventually decided on ‘transforming the healthcare sector using information systems.’ The motivation behind this choice my interest in learning about the healthcare sector despite having limited knowledge. I have started participating in the discussion forum from the previous unit and selected a case study on UX dark patterns. This connected previous knowledge and provided enlightenment. The reading material, specifically from Dawson (2015), was helpful in creating a blueprint and generating ideas for the literature review and research proposals. However, I struggled to catch up with the reading and activities, which could affect my performance. To improve, I plan to allocate more time and effort to the module to achieve better results. </p>

											<p>This unit covered research methods and data collection methods. I realised that a quality research paper involves various components. I struggled with understanding certain techniques and determining which methods to use based on the research topic and objectives. The reading material provided limited assistance in this regard, prompting me to seek additional independent reading to gain a better understanding of research design and methods. I was behind on the module due to simultaneous commitments, such as another forensics investigations assessment and work-related obligations. I intend to catch up and prioritize reading materials that will enhance my understanding of research methodology, with the hopes to produce valuable and high-quality work. </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit we focused on data collection methods such as case studies, focus groups, and observations. I was surprised at finding the unit easy to comprehend, this can be attributed to my reading and familiarity with the concepts. I believe that it is important to understand when to use specific data collection methods and visualising the desired data outcomes. I appreciated the learned further about case studies their broader applications beyond research (Crowe et al., 2011), I now see them as valuable tool for real-life experiences, understanding different situations, and testing theories and hypotheses. This knowledge will benefit my personal and professional development, enabling me to use case studies to solve complex problems, make informed decisions, and exercise sound judgment. </p>

										<h3>5. Interviews and Survey Methods</h3>

<ul>
     <li> Interview methods and survey methods.</li>
     <li> Population and sample.</li>
     <li> Pre- and post-testing.</li>
			</ul>											
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>This unit is centred on interviews, surveys, and questionnaires as data collection techniques. My initial perception of these methods was simplistic, assuming that one simply decides on the required information, creates the questionnaire, and reports the findings. However, I have learned that there is much more involved in creating effective surveys and questionnaires. I learned about the importance of ethical considerations in conducting surveys, including avoiding bias, protecting respondents, anonymising personal information, being transparent, and obtaining consent (Barrow et al., 2022) (Kaiser, 2009) (Fisher, 2020). I looked on a case study on the inappropriate use of surveys by Cambridge Analytica using Facebook (Confessore, 2018), which underscored the significance of surveys and questionnaires in research. I believe this case study will provide guidance for my future capstone project, as it shows the importance of designing surveys in an ethical manner and prioritizing the interests of the respondents. </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>This unit is a continuation of the previous week's unit and has further improved my understanding on the strategic construction of questionnaires. I learned about the importance of identifying poorly constructed questionnaires and ways to improve them to ensure clarity for respondents. The wiki activity helped in identifying poor questionnaires and emphasized the need to carefully think about questionnaire design. </p>
<p>It is also important to use disclaimers in surveys and being transparent about data processing, storage, and the length of storage (Hart et al., 2016). This also falls in line with GDPR compliance and ethical conduct. </p>
<p>The unit and the module have provided valuable insight into formulating a research paper. I believe this knowledge will benefit me in the future by enhancing my ability to plan and formulate all the necessary components required for a well-composed research work. </p><br>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was significant as it included submitting the first summative assessment, the literature review, and participating in the second collaborative discussion forum. The unit also focused on important topics such as validity, generalizability, and reliability and their impact on research design.
<p>I was faced with significant challenges during this unit due to a medical condition that required sudden treatment. As a result, I was unable to engage in learning activities as planned and could not submit my literature review timeously, leading me to request a late submission. Although I was frustrated, my health had to be prioritised, and assured myself that I will catch up once I have recovered. </p>

										<p>This was another challenging week for me. I have partially recovered from my medical condition, and still have multiple tasks to complete, including submitting my literature review, a presentation outline, reading material, and statistical worksheets.
Given the circumstances, I had to reassess my priorities and decided to prioritise the literature review as it was the summative assessment. I also had to submit another assessment in digital forensics module and had work-related projects. </p>
<p>Due to time constraints, I focused solely on completing my summative assessment before moving on to the formative assessments. I did not have enough time to thoroughly go through the reading material but had to work against the clock and planned to catch up on the other activities at a later stage. </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>My focus during the unit was on completing the statistical worksheets that involved summary measures, charts, and hypothesis testing. I did not struggle much with the worksheets due to my previous experience with similar exercises in my undergraduate studies. I found using an Excel spreadsheet to be valuable and simplified the process. I also appreciated the examples and comprehensive guidelines, recognizing their value for future statistical analysis. </p>
<p>I also received feedback from my tutor regarding my literature review. The results were not satisfactory and appreciate the tutor's feedback and constructive criticism. I did not apply myself as expected and there were several weaknesses in the assignment, particularly poor usage of sources and references. However, I viewed my tutor's feedback as a valuable developmental tool to improve my future work, as it highlighted areas for improvement and provides guidance for substantial improvement in upcoming capstone project. </p>

										<h3>10. Research Writing</h3>
											</header>
<ul>
    <li> Research reporting/writing.</li>
    <li> Sections in a dissertation and how to approach each of them.</li>
				</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was quite an interesting one as the focus was on research writing and drawing on all concepts we have learned in previous units and I’m happy I managed to submit the statistical worksheets on time which I enjoyed as I have always been good with statistics in the past. I also had a research proposal presentation submission in the form of an audio-visual. I was quite nervous about this assessment as I have always struggled with public speaking and conducting oral presentations. 
What was important about this assessment is that it evaluated not only my ability to write a quality research proposal, but also to articulate it, communicate, and present it. This also focused on presentation skills. </p>
<p>Muthusamy (2019) states that: </p>
 <p>“Learning to put together a simple and well-organized presentation will give students confidence and help them be more successful in the future. Therefore, students must realize the importance of presentation skills before stepping into industrial training or a full-time job.” </p><br>

    <li> Professional Skills matrix, Professional goals, and the outcomes of the modules I have undertaken in this programme.</li>
					</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>This unit is placed emphasis on my reflective journey, the development of my e-portfolio, professional skills matrices, and a SWOT analysis. These exercises have been helpful in reflecting on what I have learned in the course and I have become self-aware of my weaknesses, gaps, and areas for improvement. </p>
<p>I initially struggled with creating an e-portfolio using GitHub but eventually improved my skills in that area. I started my e-portfolio early on, recognizing my shortfall, the amount of work and effort required. </p>
<p>I was initially sceptical about the value of an e-portfolio, believing it to be a waste of time as recruiters don't usually require it. However, through my involvement as a computing course committee representative, I had a debate on the importance of e-portfolios and began to realise its significance. </p>
<p>Birgin (2007) states that eportfolio assessment allows students to reflect on their performance, identify their strengths and weaknesses, observe their progress, and take responsibility for their own learning. </p><br>

<p>In this unit I received feedback from my tutor pertaining to my research proposal assessment.  I was happy about the developmental feedback provided by my tutor and recognised its value in preparing me for my capstone project. I have observed my weaknesses and areas for improvement in research writing and plan to engage in self-study to enhance these skills after completing all module requirements. </p>
<p>The unit also covered project management and risk management, which I found relatively easy due to my professional work experience and managing projects. Despite not performing as well as I had hoped, I can attribute this to juggling double modules, work commitments, time constraints, and my medical condition. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the module has been interesting and highly valuable in preparation for my capstone project. The lessons and learning materials from this module will continue to be relevant and useful during my capstone project. </p>
