												<h3>1. Scientific Investigation and Ethics</h3>
											</header>
											<ul>
					

   <li> Elements within the scientific method.</li>
   <li> Aspects of ethical issues in research and professional practice.</li>
										</ul>
												<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>At the inception of this module, there was a lot to grasp in terms of reading material, lecturer cast learning material, and a seminar to prepare for and complete the collaboration discussion and the reflective activity.
This was a valuable unit and unfortunately, I was not well-prepared in terms of time as I had other engagements at the time, and planned to catch up with as soon as I had the time to do so. The reading material was of much help, although exhaustive and time-consuming, it provided a lot of insight into concepts of deductive and inductive methods of reasoning, the essence of research, and the importance of ethics. 
This was a great unit as it set the foundation and the tone for the remainder of the units as it depicts the importance of ethics in research writing, how they all fit in together, and why ethics should be part of every aspect of the research journey. Another interesting aspect I feel would be important in this unit was introducing the concepts of positivism and post-positivism, which (Adam, 2013) Defines as the epistemological and methodological frame of reference that defines the attitude and relation of the researcher to the production of data and the selection of research tools and methods.
In the future, I plan to manage my time better to afford myself enough time to apply myself in the module activities and gain valuable insight that will prepare me for future activities and engagements in the module. It is suggested that time management enhances job performance, academic achievement, and well-being (Aeon et al.,2021).

												<h3>2. Research Questions,Literature Review & the Research Proposal</h3>
											</header>
												<ul>
   <li> Formulating and revising research questions.</li>
   <li> Components of a research proposal and presenting my thoughts.</li>
   <li> What is a literature review, how to perform it, and how to present it.</li>
</ul>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was all about gathering our thoughts around our research, formulating the right topic, asking the right questions, and planning the literature review and research proposal. I had some anxiety in this unit and had a difficult time choosing a topic. I ultimately picked a topic on transforming the healthcare sector using information systems. The reason I chose this topic is that I have little knowledge of the healthcare sector but have an interest in learning about it.
I also started with the discussion forum from the previous unit as I was falling behind. Where I chose a case study on UX dark patterns, and this connected the dots and brought some enlightenment from the first unit. I also felt that the other case studies were too opaque for me, and I had little understanding of them and didn’t find the to be of any interest to my personal and professional development.
The reading material (Dawson, 2015) was of assistance in terms of creating a blueprint and drafting ideas for the final literature review and research proposals. The drawback I experience which can hamper my performance is catching up with the reading and activities. I plan to set aside more time to put more effort and yield more positive results for the module as time is all the essence in this module.

     <li> Data collection methods.</li>
</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit covered the research methods and data collection methods in research. I realized in this unit that there are a lot of components that build up a good and quality research paper. I struggled to grasp some of the techniques, and which methods to use and which method not to use based on the research topic and objectives, the reading material did not provide much assistance in this and had to do further independent reading to gain an understanding on approaching a research design and methods.
I am hoping to conclude my summary post, but still catching up on the work that I am behind with as I’m simultaneously working on another forensics investigations assessment and have work commitments as well. My focus is on the reading materials and further reading that will aid me better in providing insights into the research methodology, and to eventually provide valuable and quality work.

     <li> Advantages and drawbacks of case studies, focus groups and observation methods.</li>
     <li> Types of data I will obtain.</li>
			</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit, the focus was on the data collection methods, specifically, case studies, focus groups, and observations. I was surprised that I found the unit quite easy to comprehend, and I believe this is the extensive reading that I have undergone, or it could also be that I’m more familiar with the concepts of case studies, focus groups, and observations. 
I found it also important to understand when to use the data collection methods and to begin with the end in mind on visualizing the type of data you would like to get from using each of the methods. One interesting aspect was that of a case study, as I learned that there are more uses of a case study beyond the research (Crowe et al., 2011) and I really believe it’s a pertinent tool to use in real-life experiences, and to gain an understanding of different situations, and to test theories and hypotheses.
This will be of value in my personal and professional development as I will use a case study in many situations to solve complex problems and make sound decisions and judgments.

												<h3>5. Interviews and Survey Methods</h3>
											</header>
<ul>
     <li> Interview methods and survey methods.</li>
     <li> Population and sample.</li>
     <li> Pre- and post-testing.</li>
			</ul>											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit focused on interviews, surveys, and questionnaires. I learned that there is so much more involved when it comes to these data collection techniques.  My initial ideas for these data collection methods were that you decide on the information that you require, create the questionnaire, and collect and report on the findings.
This is not the case and is not as simple as the average person will think. Much is involved in creating questionnaires and surveys, and some important aspects need to be taken into consideration. I realized that it’s important that surveys and questionnaires need to be ethically conducted, they should not contain any bias in them as this could negatively impact the outcome of the results. Surveys also need to protect the respondents and not cause any harm, protect, and anonymize personal information, be transparent, and obtain consent from the respondents (Barrow et al., 2022) (Kaiser, 2009) (Fisher, 2020).
This was further highlighted in the case study that was part of a reflective activity on the inappropriate use of surveys conducted by Cambridge Analytica using Facebook (Confessore, 2018). This case study was very helpful in deducing the importance of surveys and questionnaires and the colossal impact they have on research. This will provide much guidance in my future capstone project and has made me aware of the importance of designing a survey in a certain way and in an ethical manner and prioritizing the interests of the respondents.

											</header>
<ul>
     <li> Methods of obtaining responses.</li>
     <li> Improving the responses I obtain.</li>
     <li> Analysing the responses from each type of question.</li>
					</ul>											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This week we further expanded on the previous week’s unit. I have further improved my knowledge of the art of strategically constructing questionnaires, identifying poorly constructed questionnaires, and ways in which we can improve them to get the best responses possible which will not further confuse the respondents.
The wiki activity also assisted in identifying poor questionnaires and realizing that it’s important to think about the questionnaires.
Another important aspect is that of using a disclaimer in the surveys and being transparent in terms of how the data will be processed, and stored, and the length of storage (Hart et al., 2016). This also is in line with complying with GDPR and forms part of the ethical conduct as I learned from unit 1 that this is the foundation and needs to be included in every part of the research writing.
This unit and the module so far have provided insight into formulating a research paper and will help me in the future to better plan and formulate all components that I must consider when composing this piece of work.

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was an important part of the module as we were required to submit our first summative assessment, which is the literature review, and to begin engaging in the second collaborative discussion forum. The module also focused on pertinent issues relating to validity, generalisability, and reliability and their impact on the research design.
Unfortunately, this was the unit where I encountered a lot of challenges and have a medical condition that abruptly sent me to the hospital for treatment, as a result, I could not engage in any learning activities in the unit as I wished and could not submit my literature review and had to apply for a late submission. Although frustrating, this was a situation beyond my control, and had to prioritize my health and assured myself that I will catch up once I have recovered.

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This week was another challenging one for me, I have partially recovered from my medical condition and a lot is going through my mind, still must submit my literature review, there is also a presentation outline, reading material, and statistical worksheets to submit.
From this situation, I had to re-assess the way forward and decided to prioritize the literature review as it was the summative assessment, in addition to that, I had another assessment that I had to submit in my Digital forensics module and had to catch up with work-related projects.
I have focused purely on my summative assessments, then moved towards the formative assessments, unfortunately, I did not have enough time to prepare and go through the reading material. Nonetheless, I had to work against time and catch up on the other activities at a later stage.

    <li> Methods to analyse, interpret and present results from qualitative data.</li>
    <li> Advantages and drawbacks of each of these methods of the various methods.</li>
					</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit, my focus was on the completion of the statistical worksheets composed of summary measures, charts, and hypothesis testing. I did not struggle much with the worksheets as I have done similar exercises in my undergraduate studies, the only difference here is that I had to use an Excel spreadsheet which proved to be valuable and did this with more simplicity. I’m glad the worksheets provided examples and a comprehensive guideline and explanation on each of them, and these would prove to be of value in the future when conducting statistical analysis of this sort.
During this unit I also received tutor feedback on my late submission of the literature review, the results were not satisfactory, and I did welcome the tutor’s feedback and constructive criticism of the assignment. I must admit that I did not apply myself as I was expected to in the assessment and the were several weaknesses in the assignment which included poor usage of sources and references. However, I appreciated the tutor’s feedback as it highlighted the areas of improvement, and the feedback was a valuable developmental tool for me to substantially improve my future work.

											</header>
<ul>
    <li> Research reporting/writing.</li>

				</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was quite an interesting one as the focus was on research writing and drawing on all concepts we have learned in previous units and I’m happy I managed to submit the statistical worksheets on time which I enjoyed as I have always been good with statistics in the past. I also had a research proposal presentation submission in the form of an audio-visual. I was quite nervous about this assessment as I have always struggled with public speaking and conducting oral presentations. 
What was important about this assessment is that it evaluated not only my ability to write a quality research proposal, but also to articulate it, communicate, and present it. This also focused on presentation skills. 
Muthusamy (2019) states that:
 “Learning to put together a simple and well-organized presentation will give students confidence and help them be more successful in the future. Therefore, students must realize the importance of presentation skills before stepping into industrial training or a full-time job.”

<ul>
    <li> My learning approach based on my reflections on my learning process.</li>
    <li> Professional Skills matrix, Professional goals, and the outcomes of the modules I have undertaken in this programme.</li>
					</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit, much emphasis was placed on our reflective journey, the development of our e-portfolio, professional skills matrices, and a SWOT analysis. I have realized that these exercises have helped me in gaining an understanding of what I have learned so far in this course and made me self-aware of my weaknesses and identify gaps and areas of improvement.
One area of weakness in this course for me was the creation of an e-portfolio, as we had to use GitHub and I struggled the first time I had to create an e-portfolio using GitHub and eventually improved on it. The positive side is that I started my e-portfolio of this module on the first day as I knew the amount of work and effort that is required for an e-portfolio.
Another aspect is that I did not see the value of an e-portfolio and genuinely thought it is a waste of time and recruiters don’t usually require this.  As a computing course committee representative at the University of Essex Online, we had a debate in one of our meetings with different tutors on the importance of e-portfolios and part of me was starting to realize the importance of an e-portfolio. 
A study by Birgin (2007) states that: “ Portfolio assessment enables students to reflect their real performance, to show their weak and strong domain and to observe student’s progress during the learning process, and encourages students to take responsibilities for their own learning”.

						</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit, I also had a chance to go through my tutor’s feedback pertaining to my Research Proposal, there has been an improvement in my writing skills, however, I received developmental feedback from the tutor which I believe will help me towards my capstone project. I have managed to identify my weaknesses and areas of improvement when it comes to my research writing skills. I now plan to conduct a self-study once I have submitted all my module requirements with the aim of substantially improving my research writing skills in preparation for the capstone project.
This unit also touched on project management and managing risk, which I found to be quite easy on my side as this forms part of my professional work daily, and I found the reflective activity to be quite fair. So far, I might not have performed as well as I wanted to, and this can be attributed to doing double modules, work and time constraints, and my medical condition. Nonetheless, this has been an interesting module and I have learned a lot from it, and it is quite essential to prepare for the capstone project, several lessons can be used from here and the learning materials will still be of use during the capstone project.
