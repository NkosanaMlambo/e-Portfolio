   <li> Elements within the scientific method.</li>
   <li> Aspects of ethical issues in research and professional practice.</li>

												<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>Initial challenges faced in the module included a large amount of reading material, learning materials from the lecturer, and the need to prepare for a seminar and collaborative discussions. This was a valuable unit, but I was not well-prepared due to other commitments. The reading material provided insights into deductive and inductive reasoning, research concepts, and the importance of ethics. The unit set the foundation for understanding the role of ethics in research and I believe it should have also introduced the concepts of positivism and post-positivism, which Adam (2013) defines as the epistemological and methodological frame of reference that defines the attitude and relation of the researcher to the production of data and the selection of research tools and methods. I plan to improve my time management in the future to fully engage with module activities. The importance of time management enhances job performance, academic achievement, and well-being (Aeon et al., 2021). </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>The focus of the unit involved selecting a research topic, formulating questions, and planning the literature review and research proposal. I experienced anxiety when choosing a topic but eventually decided on ‘transforming the healthcare sector using information systems.’ The motivation behind this choice my interest in learning about the healthcare sector despite having limited knowledge. I have started participating in the discussion forum from the previous unit and selected a case study on UX dark patterns. This connected previous knowledge and provided enlightenment. The reading material, specifically from Dawson (2015), was helpful in creating a blueprint and generating ideas for the literature review and research proposals. However, I struggled to catch up with the reading and activities, which could affect my performance. To improve, I plan to allocate more time and effort to the module to achieve better results. </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit covered research methods and data collection methods. I realised that a quality research paper involves various components. I struggled with understanding certain techniques and determining which methods to use based on the research topic and objectives. The reading material provided limited assistance in this regard, prompting me to seek additional independent reading to gain a better understanding of research design and methods. I was behind on the module due to simultaneous commitments, such as another forensics investigations assessment and work-related obligations. I intend to catch up and prioritize reading materials that will enhance my understanding of research methodology, with the hopes to produce valuable and high-quality work. </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit we focused on data collection methods such as case studies, focus groups, and observations. I was surprised at finding the unit easy to comprehend, this can be attributed to my reading and familiarity with the concepts. I believe that it is important to understand when to use specific data collection methods and visualising the desired data outcomes. I appreciated the learned further about case studies their broader applications beyond research (Crowe et al., 2011), I now see them as valuable tool for real-life experiences, understanding different situations, and testing theories and hypotheses. This knowledge will benefit my personal and professional development, enabling me to use case studies to solve complex problems, make informed decisions, and exercise sound judgment. </p>

										<h3>5. Interviews and Survey Methods</h3>

<ul>
     <li> Interview methods and survey methods.</li>
     <li> Population and sample.</li>
     <li> Pre- and post-testing.</li>
			</ul>											
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>This unit is centred on interviews, surveys, and questionnaires as data collection techniques. My initial perception of these methods was simplistic, assuming that one simply decides on the required information, creates the questionnaire, and reports the findings. However, I have learned that there is much more involved in creating effective surveys and questionnaires. I learned about the importance of ethical considerations in conducting surveys, including avoiding bias, protecting respondents, anonymising personal information, being transparent, and obtaining consent (Barrow et al., 2022) (Kaiser, 2009) (Fisher, 2020). I looked on a case study on the inappropriate use of surveys by Cambridge Analytica using Facebook (Confessore, 2018), which underscored the significance of surveys and questionnaires in research. I believe this case study will provide guidance for my future capstone project, as it shows the importance of designing surveys in an ethical manner and prioritizing the interests of the respondents. </p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>This unit is a continuation of the previous week's unit and has further improved my understanding on the strategic construction of questionnaires. I learned about the importance of identifying poorly constructed questionnaires and ways to improve them to ensure clarity for respondents. The wiki activity helped in identifying poor questionnaires and emphasized the need to carefully think about questionnaire design. </p>
<p>It is also important to use disclaimers in surveys and being transparent about data processing, storage, and the length of storage (Hart et al., 2016). This also falls in line with GDPR compliance and ethical conduct. </p>
<p>The unit and the module have provided valuable insight into formulating a research paper. I believe this knowledge will benefit me in the future by enhancing my ability to plan and formulate all the necessary components required for a well-composed research work. </p>

				</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was an important part of the module as we were required to submit our first summative assessment, which is the literature review, and to begin engaging in the second collaborative discussion forum. The module also focused on pertinent issues relating to validity, generalisability, and reliability and their impact on the research design.</p><br>
<p>Unfortunately, this was the unit where I encountered a lot of challenges and have a medical condition that abruptly sent me to the hospital for treatment, as a result, I could not engage in any learning activities in the unit as I wished and could not submit my literature review and had to apply for a late submission. Although frustrating, this was a situation beyond my control, and had to prioritize my health and assured myself that I will catch up once I have recovered.</p>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This week was another challenging one for me, I have partially recovered from my medical condition and a lot is going through my mind, still must submit my literature review, there is also a presentation outline, reading material, and statistical worksheets to submit.</p>
<p>From this situation, I had to re-assess the way forward and decided to prioritize the literature review as it was the summative assessment, in addition to that, I had another assessment that I had to submit in my Digital forensics module and had to catch up with work-related projects.</p><br>
<p>I have focused purely on my summative assessments, then moved towards the formative assessments, unfortunately, I did not have enough time to prepare and go through the reading material. Nonetheless, I had to work against time and catch up on the other activities at a later stage.</p>

    <li> Methods to analyse, interpret and present results from qualitative data.</li>
    <li> Advantages and drawbacks of each of these methods of the various methods.</li>
					</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>In this unit, my focus was on the completion of the statistical worksheets composed of summary measures, charts, and hypothesis testing. I did not struggle much with the worksheets as I have done similar exercises in my undergraduate studies, the only difference here is that I had to use an Excel spreadsheet which proved to be valuable and did this with more simplicity. I’m glad the worksheets provided examples and a comprehensive guideline and explanation on each of them, and these would prove to be of value in the future when conducting statistical analysis of this sort.</p><br>
<p>During this unit I also received tutor feedback on my late submission of the literature review, the results were not satisfactory, and I did welcome the tutor’s feedback and constructive criticism of the assignment. I must admit that I did not apply myself as I was expected to in the assessment and there were several weaknesses in the assignment which included poor usage of sources and references. However, I appreciated the tutor’s feedback as it highlighted the areas of improvement, and the feedback was a valuable developmental tool for me to substantially improve my future work.</p>

										<h3>10. Research Writing</h3>
											</header>
<ul>
    <li> Research reporting/writing.</li>
    <li> Sections in a dissertation and how to approach each of them.</li>
				</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was quite an interesting one as the focus was on research writing and drawing on all concepts we have learned in previous units and I’m happy I managed to submit the statistical worksheets on time which I enjoyed as I have always been good with statistics in the past. I also had a research proposal presentation submission in the form of an audio-visual. I was quite nervous about this assessment as I have always struggled with public speaking and conducting oral presentations. 
What was important about this assessment is that it evaluated not only my ability to write a quality research proposal, but also to articulate it, communicate, and present it. This also focused on presentation skills.</p><br>
<p>Muthusamy (2019) states that:</p>
 <p>“Learning to put together a simple and well-organized presentation will give students confidence and help them be more successful in the future. Therefore, students must realize the importance of presentation skills before stepping into industrial training or a full-time job.”</p><br>

										<h3>11. Professional Development</h3>

<ul>
    <li> My learning approach based on my reflections on my learning process.</li>
    <li> Professional Skills matrix, Professional goals, and the outcomes of the modules I have undertaken in this programme.</li>
					</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>In this unit, much emphasis was placed on our reflective journey, the development of our e-portfolio, professional skills matrices, and a SWOT analysis. I have realized that these exercises have helped me in gaining an understanding of what I have learned so far in this course and made me self-aware of my weaknesses and identify gaps and areas of improvement.</p><br>
<p>One area of weakness in this course for me was the creation of an e-portfolio, as we had to use GitHub and I struggled the first time I had to create an e-portfolio using GitHub and eventually improved on it. The positive side is that I started my e-portfolio of this module on the first day as I knew the amount of work and effort that is required for an e-portfolio.</p><br>
<p>Another aspect is that I did not see the value of an e-portfolio and genuinely thought it is a waste of time and recruiters don’t usually require this.  As a computing course committee representative at the University of Essex Online, we had a debate in one of our meetings with different tutors on the importance of e-portfolios and part of me was starting to realize the importance of an e-portfolio.</p>
<p>A study by Birgin (2007) states that: “ Portfolio assessment enables students to reflect their real performance, to show their weak and strong domain and to observe student’s progress during the learning process, and encourages students to take responsibilities for their own learning”.</p><br>

						</ul>
											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
<p>In this unit, I also had a chance to go through my tutor’s feedback pertaining to my Research Proposal, there has been an improvement in my writing skills, however, I received developmental feedback from the tutor which I believe will help me towards my capstone project. I have managed to identify my weaknesses and areas of improvement when it comes to my research writing skills. I now plan to conduct a self-study once I have submitted all my module requirements with the aim of substantially improving my research writing skills in preparation for the capstone project.</p><br>
<p>This unit also touched on project management and managing risk, which I found to be quite easy on my side as this forms part of my professional work daily, and I found the reflective activity to be quite fair. So far, I might not have performed as well as I wanted to, and this can be attributed to doing double modules, work and time constraints, and my medical condition. Nonetheless, this has been an interesting module and I have learned a lot from it, and it is quite essential to prepare for the capstone project, several lessons can be used from here and the learning materials will still be of use during the capstone project.</p>
