<li>Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals</li>
<li>Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.</li>
<li>Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.</li>
<li>Produce and evaluate critically the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic.</li>

												<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit covered the research methods and data collection methods in research. I realized in this unit that there are a lot of components that build up a good and quality research paper. I struggled to grasp some of the techniques, and which methods to use and which method not to use based on the research topic and objectives, the reading material did not provide much assistance in this and had to do further independent reading to gain an understanding on approaching a research design and methods.</p><br>
<p>I am hoping to conclude my summary post, but still catching up on the work that I am behind with as I’m simultaneously working on another forensics investigations assessment and have work commitments as well. My focus is on the reading materials and further reading that will aid me better in providing insights into the research methodology, and to eventually provide valuable and quality work.</p>

												<h3>2. Research Questions,Literature Review & the Research Proposal</h3>
											</header>
												<ul>
   <li> Formulating and revising research questions.</li>
   <li> Components of a research proposal and presenting my thoughts.</li>
   <li> What is a literature review, how to perform it, and how to present it.</li>
</ul>

											<h4> Unit Reflection & Artefacts</h4>
											<p>This unit was all about gathering our thoughts around our research, formulating the right topic, asking the right questions, and planning the literature review and research proposal. I had some anxiety in this unit and had a difficult time choosing a topic. I ultimately picked a topic on transforming the healthcare sector using information systems. The reason I chose this topic is that I have little knowledge of the healthcare sector but have an interest in learning about it.</p><br>
<p>I also started with the discussion forum from the previous unit as I was falling behind. Where I chose a case study on UX dark patterns, and this connected the dots and brought some enlightenment from the first unit. I also felt that the other case studies were too opaque for me, and I had little understanding of them and didn’t find the to be of any interest to my personal and professional development.</p><br>
<p>The reading material (Dawson, 2015) was of assistance in terms of creating a blueprint and drafting ideas for the final literature review and research proposals. The drawback I experience which can hamper my performance is catching up with the reading and activities. I plan to set aside more time to put more effort and yield more positive results for the module as time is all the essence in this module.</p><br>
